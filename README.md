## Why this project?
AI accelerates features, but it also introduces new security, privacy, and compliance risks. Secure AI Coding aims to:
- Reduce accidental data exposure (secrets, PII)
- Standardize safe model usage patterns
- Automate security checks in CI
- Provide clear, copy-pasteable examples and templates

## Key features
- Security-first AI integration recipes (rate limiting, input sanitization)
- Secret scanning, dependency auditing, and CI examples
- Example code for model invocation patterns in Python and Node.js
- Threat model checklist and privacy guidance
- Contributing templates, PR checklist, and security policy
